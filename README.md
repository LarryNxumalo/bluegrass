# Hi, below is a github repo to this project

# How long it took me for the assessment

```
The total time spent was 52hours:

- I spent most of my time setting up the project, I initially wanted to add Amazon Amplify authentication
and a graphQL api endpoint which took me +-8hours.

- I worked on the components adding colours, fonts, downloading images and icons from invision which was +-6hours.

- Building the layout and adding Vuex state management took me approximately 9 to 10 hours.

- Bulding Desktop version 1 and testing browser compatibility took me at least 16 to 17 hours

- Mobile version 1 and Desktop version 2 refining the styling and transitions +-10 -12 hours. 
```
# List any bugs or issues you’re aware of and/or functionality you omitted and why?

```
- There is one console bug complaining about a vue Teleport package component but the code for that component works with no issues.

- I omitted AWS Amplify GraphQL API and Authentication as this was eating up a lot of my time and I felt like I will not make it on time if I continued implementing it. I could authenticate and got the data back from Amazon but I got a black white screen just after signing in.

- Because of time I also could not add an intersection observer to show and hide the icons on the Navigation bar on scroll as well as the tooltips and a favicon.

```
# List any bugs or issues you’re aware of and/or functionality you omitted and why?

```
- The challange I had was not knowing if I should add Authentication on the project as well as screens or views for the Cart and the payment details.

- I added two buttons on top of the Navigation bar that will trigger the Toast for a succesful Password change as well as one for toggling the modal for Removing payment details.
